# Krazy Kart
This is a multiplayer project in Unreal Engine. It has controlled cars as pawn, instead of Unreal's vehicle. The purpose is to try and make the movement as smooth as possible in multiplayer, considering the possible lags. It shows state synchronisation and shows how to compensate lack of information on the client, for example with Hermit Cubic Spline Interpolation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_Hermite_spline). It also shows cheat protection by using some validation in RPC calls. And tries to keep the level consistent by seperating collision and visiual side of multiplayer game.
